    <h2>Great for summertime</h2>
    <p>Our all-time favorite meat item! Everybody who has ever had this has flipped out! It's so easy and make extra and freeze it for a meal in 5 minutes. </p>
    <p>Give it a try -- I promise you won't be disappointed! Serve with a squeeze of lemon -- fantastic hot or at room temperature.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds beef rump roast</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>4 cups dry bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the beef roast into the freezer for several hours, until very firm and almost frozen. Slice the beef about 1/8 inch thick across the grain. You can also ask the butcher to slice it very thinly for you.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs and water together in a bowl. Spread the bread crumbs out onto a large sheet of aluminum foil, and sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and Parmesan cheese. Mix all the crumb ingredients together until well combined. Dip each piece of beef into the egg mixture, then thoroughly coat with crumbs. Place the coated slices onto a sheet of foil on a baking sheet, and separate them with waxed paper as you dip and coat the beef.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy skillet until shimmering, and pan-fry the beef slices until golden brown, about 2 minutes on the first side and 1 minute on the second side. Fry 2 or 3 slices per batch.</li>
    </ol>
